:: Windows 10 Hardening Script
:: This is based mostly on my own personal research and testing. My objective is to secure/harden Windows 10 as much as possible while not impacting usability at all. (Think being able to run on this computer's of family members so secure them but not increase the chances of them having to call you to troubleshoot something related to it later on). References for virtually all settings can be found at the bottom. Just before the references section, you will always find several security settings commented out as they could lead to compatibility issues in common consumer setups but they're worth considering.

### IDS / IPS / Host IDS / Host IPS

- [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) - Snort - это бесплатная система с открытым исходным кодом для предотвращения вторжений (NIPS) и система обнаружения вторжений в сеть (NIDS), созданная Мартином Рошем в 1998 году. Snort в настоящее время разрабатывается. Sourcefire, основателем которого является Роеш и технический директор. В 2009 году Snort вошел в Зал Славы InfoWorld с открытым исходным кодом как одно из «величайших [образцов] программного обеспечения с открытым исходным кодом всех времен».
- [Bro](https://www.bro.org/) - Bro - это мощная инфраструктура сетевого анализа, которая сильно отличается от типичной IDS, которую вы, возможно, знаете.
- [OSSEC](https://ossec.github.io/) - Комплексная HIDS с открытым исходным кодом. Не для слабонервных. Требуется немного, чтобы понять, как это работает. Выполняет анализ журналов, проверку целостности файлов, мониторинг политик, обнаружение руткитов, оповещение в режиме реального времени и активный ответ. Он работает в большинстве операционных систем, включая Linux, MacOS, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX и Windows. Много разумной документации. Сладкое место - от среднего до крупного развертывания.
- [Suricata](http://suricata-ids.org/) - Suricata - это высокопроизводительный механизм мониторинга сетевых IDS, IPS и сетевой безопасности. Open Source и принадлежит общественному некоммерческому фонду Open Foundation Security Foundation (OISF). Suricata разработана OISF и его поставщиками.
- [Security Onion](http://blog.securityonion.net/) - Security Onion - это дистрибутив Linux для обнаружения вторжений, мониторинга сетевой безопасности и управления журналами. Он основан на Ubuntu и содержит Snort, Suricata, Bro, OSSEC, Sguil, Squert, Snorby, ELSA, Xplico, NetworkMiner и многие другие инструменты безопасности. Простой в использовании мастер установки позволяет создать целую армию распределенных датчиков для вашего предприятия за считанные минуты!
- [sshwatch](https://github.com/marshyski/sshwatch) - IPS для SSH аналогичен DenyHosts, написанному на Python. Он также может собирать информацию о злоумышленнике во время атаки в журнале.
- [Stealth](https://fbb-git.github.io/stealth/) - Проверка целостности файла, которая практически не оставляет осадка. Контроллер запускается с другого компьютера, что затрудняет злоумышленнику узнать, что файловая система проверяется через определенные псевдослучайные интервалы по SSH. Настоятельно рекомендуется для малых и средних развертываний.
- [AIEngine](https://bitbucket.org/camp0/aiengine) - AIEngine - это интерактивное / программируемое средство проверки пакетов Python / Ruby / Java / Lua следующего поколения с возможностями обучения без какого-либо вмешательства человека, NIDS (обнаружение вторжений в сеть) Системный) функционал, классификация доменов DNS, сетевой коллектор, криминалистика сети и многое другое.
- [Denyhosts](http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/) - Помешать атакам на основе словаря SSH и атакам методом перебора.
- [Fail2Ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) - сканирует файлы журналов и выполняет действия по IP-адресам, которые показывают вредоносное поведение.
- [SSHGuard](http://www.sshguard.net/) - программное обеспечение для защиты служб в дополнение к SSH, написанное на C
- [Lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis/) - инструмент аудита безопасности с открытым исходным кодом для Linux / Unix.

## Honey Pot / Honey Net

- [awesome-honeypots](https://github.com/paralax/awesome-honeypots) - Канонический список потрясающих приманок.
- [HoneyPy](https://github.com/foospidy/HoneyPy) - HoneyPy - это приманка с низким и средним уровнем взаимодействия. Он предназначен для простого развертывания, расширения функциональности с помощью плагинов и применения пользовательских конфигураций.
- [Dionaea](https://www.edgis-security.org/honeypot/dionaea/). Предполагается, что Dionaea станет преемником nepenthes, внедряет python в качестве языка сценариев, использует libemu для обнаружения шелл-кодов, поддерживает ipv6 и tls.
- [Conpot](http://conpot.org/) - ICS / SCADA Honeypot. Conpot - это приманка для систем промышленного управления с низким уровнем интерактивности на стороне сервера, разработанная для простого развертывания, изменения и расширения. Предоставляя ряд общих протоколов управления производством, мы создали основы для создания собственной системы, способной эмулировать сложные инфраструктуры, чтобы убедить противника в том, что он только что нашел огромный промышленный комплекс. Чтобы улучшить возможности обмана, мы также предоставили возможность сервера настраивать пользовательский интерфейс «человек-машина», чтобы увеличить поверхность атаки «приманок». Время отклика сервисов может быть искусственно задержано, чтобы имитировать поведение системы при постоянной нагрузке. Поскольку мы предоставляем полные стеки протоколов, к Conpot можно получить доступ с помощью производительных HMI или расширить с помощью реального оборудования.
- [Amun](https://github.com/zeroq/amun) - Honeypot с низким уровнем взаимодействия на основе Python.
- [Glastopf](http://glastopf.org/) - Glastopf - это Honeypot, который эмулирует тысячи уязвимостей для сбора данных от атак, направленных на веб-приложения. Принцип, лежащий в основе этого, очень прост: ответьте на правильный ответ злоумышленнику, использующему веб-приложение.
- [Kippo](https://github.com/desaster/kippo) - Kippo - это медпот SSH со средним взаимодействием, предназначенный для регистрации атак с использованием грубой силы и, что наиболее важно, всего взаимодействия с оболочкой, выполняемого атакующим.
- [Kojoney](http://kojoney.sourceforge.net/) - Kojoney - это приманка для взаимодействия низкого уровня, эмулирующая SSH-сервер. Демон написан на Python с использованием библиотек Twisted Conch.
- [HonSSH](https://github.com/tnich/honssh) - HonSSH - это решение Honey Pot с высоким уровнем взаимодействия. HonSSH будет находиться между атакующим и медом, создавая две отдельные SSH-связи между ними.
- [Bifrozt](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bifrozt/) - Bifrozt - это устройство NAT с сервером DHCP, которое обычно развертывается с одним NIC, подключенным напрямую к Интернету, и одним NIC, подключенным к внутренней сети. Что отличает Bifrozt от других стандартных устройств NAT, так это его способность работать в качестве прозрачного прокси-сервера SSHv2 между злоумышленником и вашей приманкой. Если вы развернете SSH-сервер во внутренней сети Bifrozt, он запишет все взаимодействия в файл TTY в виде простого текста, который можно будет просмотреть позже, и получит копию всех загруженных файлов. Вам не нужно устанавливать какое-либо дополнительное программное обеспечение, компилировать какие-либо модули ядра или использовать определенную версию или тип операционной системы на внутреннем сервере SSH, чтобы это работало.
- [HoneyDrive](http://bruteforce.gr/honeydrive) - HoneyDrive - это лучший Linux-дистрибутив honeypot. Это виртуальное устройство (OVA) с установленной версией Xubuntu Desktop 12.04.4 LTS. Он содержит более 10 предустановленных и предварительно настроенных пакетов программного обеспечения honeypot, таких как honeyppot Kippo SSH, honeypot с вредоносным ПО Dionaea и Amun, honeypot с низким уровнем взаимодействия Honeyd, honeypot и Wordpot Glastopf, Honeypot Conpot SCADA / ICS, honeyclients Thug и PhoneyC и многое другое. , Кроме того, он включает в себя множество полезных предварительно настроенных сценариев и утилит для анализа, визуализации и обработки данных, которые он может захватывать, таких как Kippo-Graph, Honeyd-Viz, DionaeaFR, стек ELK и многое другое. Наконец, в дистрибутиве также присутствует почти 90 известных инструментов анализа вредоносных программ, криминалистики и мониторинга сети.
- [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org/) - Cuckoo Sandbox - это программное обеспечение с открытым исходным кодом для автоматизации анализа подозрительных файлов. Для этого используются пользовательские компоненты, которые отслеживают поведение вредоносных процессов при работе в изолированной среде.
- [T-Pot Honeypot Distro](http://dtag-dev-sec.github.io/mediator/feature/2017/11/07/t-pot-17.10.html) - T-Pot основан на сети установщик Ubuntu Server 16 / 17.x LTS. Демоны honeypot, а также другие используемые компоненты поддержки были упакованы в контейнеры с помощью Docker. Это позволяет нам запускать несколько демонов honeypot в одном сетевом интерфейсе, сохраняя при этом небольшую площадь и ограничивая каждую honeypot в пределах собственной среды. Установка поверх стандартной Ubuntu - [T-Pot Autoinstall(https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/t-pot-autoinstall) - Этот скрипт установит T-Pot 16.04 / 17.10 на свежую Ubuntu 16.04.x LTS (64 бита). Он предназначен для использования на хост-серверах, где указан базовый образ Ubuntu и нет возможности устанавливать собственные образы ISO. Успешно протестирован на ванильной Ubuntu 16.04.3 в VMware.
